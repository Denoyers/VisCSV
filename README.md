# VisCSV

## What is VisCSV?
VisCSV is a small programm to visualize data.
It takes .csv files or .txt files (with csv-like shape) as input and writes the output graph into a .png file.

## What types of files are supported?
Currently supported are files with a header and the delimiters "\t" (a tab) and ";" (not a greek question mark).

## Why do I cannot understand a thing?
All texts are written in german. Maybe I will add other languages as well.

## What can you do with it?
You can change, which data you want to visualize by selecting the desired data row.

## Where is my saved diagram?
It is saved at the location of the executable with the name of the diagram.

## "Diagramm anzeigen" also saves!
This button does not only show your new diagram, it also saves it. So be avare of that and do not overwrite your old work.
